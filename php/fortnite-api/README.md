Fortnite API (get player stats, leaderboards and more)

Hi,

You can get user wins, kills, the latest news, fortnite server status and many more with this API.

It's easy to install, just put the fortnite-api/Autoloader.php in your directory and define the class. After that visit my documentation (https://fortniteapi.com/docs (only php) or https://goo.gl/XC6u9S (all frameworks)) and follow the steps.

Have fun!
